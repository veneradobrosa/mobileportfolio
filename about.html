		<h2>IWTA</h2>
		<p>Grandmaster Leung Ting, founder of the International WingTsun™ Association, began teaching WingTsun™ Kungfu in 1967 as an instructor.
			In the following year he started a Wing Tsun training class in the Baptist College, the first kingfu class ever established in a university of Hong Kong.
			Then in May 1970, he set up a well-equipped gymnasium, called the Leung Ting Gymnasium, and commenced to admit students publicly, and turned teaching martial arts
			into a career.With the support of his followers and kungfu brothers, Grandmaster Leung founded the Wing Tsun Leung Ting Martial-Art Assocation on 24 July 1973.
			The full registered title of the Association was in fact the “Wing Tsun Leung Ting Martial-Art Association & Leung Ting Gymnasium”.
			Membership of this organization was based on all the Wing Tsun practitioners of the Leung Ting Gymnasium but was extended to accept other individuals
			who had an interest in Wing Tsun but might not necessarily be practicing the technique.</p>

		<h2>The Association</h2>
		<p> The functions of the International WingTsun™ Association are twofold: the propagation and promotion of the WingTsun™ System and the training of practitioners.
			The Association overall is an organization established to develop and promote the WingTsun™ System in all parts of the world and is therefore open to anybody
			interested to pursue this mission, whether or not they are practicing the technique. The Association is administered by an Executive Committee with officials
			elected amongst members.An important part of the Association is the teaching of the WingTsun™ System and the training of practitioners.
			The administration of affairs on this side is handled by a special section of the Association overseen by an independent
			Committee (called the Committee of the Gymnasium). The Committee will ensure that all the gymnasiums are adequately equipped and that all training
			and coaching are undertaken with the highest standard by approved and qualified instructors. All practitioners enrolled to receive training must
			first register as members of the Association.
